\noindent \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{keagan}\\I am first and foremost career-driven. My primary aspirations in life are reaching for the highest branches of my career and having a healthy family lifestyle. While enjoying all aspects of life as a student, I still strive to always consider my future successes in society and the impact that any actions I commit may have on others as a result. Whilst acknowledging that it is necessary to help others to the best of my ability in advancing their own lives, I take a larger interest in ensuring a secure, comfortable lifestyle for myself. The technological environment has captivated my interest from a very young age and my fixation on developing technology that will help the human race in experiencing a more enjoyable life is a testament to that. It is through software development that I hope to leave my legacy in this world, since I see this as the most effective way for myself to leave this world in a better state than I found it. I am eager to tackle new challenges and pride myself on the fact that I am always able to find a solution to a problem. It is for this reason that I can describe my approach to programming using the expression "Where there is a will, there is a way". Although I am confident of my abilities as a software developer, I respect the fact that there are people who have a much broader knowledge of the field than I do and am willing to learn from these people in order to further my own experience.

\inlineheadsection
  {Social skills:}
  {I am a person who has a witty sense of humour. I see myself as the forerunner of my group of friends and am always keen to organise a get-together at my place of residence. In terms of meeting new people, I portray my true self because I believe in always being who I am, and I have been in contact with many different kinds of people so I have a good understanding of communication with most people.}
\inlineheadsection
  {Professional skills:}
  {I always try my best to be punctual and to have work completed by the deadline as this is the only way a group will be able to complete a project effectively and I like to consider actions carefully in conflict situations rather than force my own ideas upon others.}

\roottitle{Why DVT Drive Stats?}

\inlineheadsection
  {Because:}
  {This project has an element of mobile development and benefit to our community. I feel that driving in South Africa is a dangerous daily task and a system that rates drivers will improve awareness of safe driving. This project falls in line with the kind of work I would like to do one day and so am ready to tackle this new venture.}
