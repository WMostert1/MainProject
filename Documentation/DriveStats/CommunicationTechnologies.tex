\subsection{Client-Developer Communication}
Even though we as a team will be able to work independently, we do acknowledge the need to be in contact with the client in order to keep him/her informed. We are flexible in terms of which technologies to use if it is not possible to meet physically. Skype, WhatsApp, Google+ Hangouts and E-mail are some of the various ways of communicating which we are comfortable with. We will always make sure to keep the client in the loop of our project, whether this is by physically meeting or by using digital communication. If it is needed to physically meet with the client, we will always schedule the meeting far ahead and will be reliable in terms of showing up on time, etc.
