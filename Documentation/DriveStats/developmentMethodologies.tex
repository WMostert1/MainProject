\subsubsection{Technologies to be Used}
After due consideration and taking into account the received requirements, the following technologies will be used:
\begin{description}
	\item[ASP.NET MVC 5]\hfill\\
	%Description
	This will be used to develop the back-end of the system, using Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE.
	\item[ASP.NET Web API]\hfill\\
	This will form the back-bone of the API with which the rest system will interact (possibly hosted in the cloud).
	\item[C\#]\hfill\\
	Will be used together with .NET development.
	\item[MySQL]\hfill\\	
	This is the relation database which will be used.
	\item[Xamarin or Android Studio]\hfill\\
	The decision has yet to be made on whether the C\# Xamarin approach will be used or the traditional Java in Android Studio approach. One of these two will however reign supreme.
