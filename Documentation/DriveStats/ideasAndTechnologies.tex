\subsubsection{Project Extension Ideas}
The following was considered as possible future extensions on the current project specifications:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Android watch notification sister-application\\
	The idea behind this is that while the main app is tracking the user's travelling speed, if it is the case that a user is travelling at a rate which is greater than the speed limit in his vicinity the user will be made aware of this fact. This alert can take place in the form of vibrations or sound emitted by the watch as to not interfere with the user's driving.
