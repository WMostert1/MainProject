Adaptable and very open to learning new programming languages and methodologies, in order to build on previous knowledge. Hardworking yet still innovative. I try to live a live with as many experiences as possible cause I believe we can only learn and grow from things that challenge us. I am uncomfortable in my comfort zone.

\roottitle{Why CSIR Eaves Dropping Protection?}

\inlineheadsection
  {Because:}
  {I am interested in incorporating various technologies together and this project allows me to do so. We will be combining mobile app development with various speech recognition software, and this will be a challenge and eventually a reward.
