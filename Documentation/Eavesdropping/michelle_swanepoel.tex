\noindent \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{michelle}\\I see myself as a person who is invested in my personal growth in all aspects of my life. I am currently double majoring and still deciding whether I want to do honours degree next year or start working.  When I feel everything around me is going to fast and that I need a getaway, I will most definitely grab the book I'm currently reading and enjoy a few pages. I also enjoy watching series, building puzzle and playing 30 Seconds with my mom and sister - and always  a cup of coffee. One of my other passions in life is dogs and animals in general. Close friends and family see me as a person who is diligent, respectful, sincere, modest and compassionate. I am an introvert, but enjoy observing and getting to know new people. I get my energy by accomplishing something that I had to work hard for and working with people.

\inlineheadsection
  {Because:}
  {When I read the project proposal for the first time, the idea immediately jumped out to me. It sounds like a fun project to do as a team and something we can be proud of afterwards. Even though the project will challenge me and I will have to learn some new technologies and skills, it sounds still within in reach for us as a team to accomplish. }
