\subsection{Ideas and Technologies}
\subsubsection{Technologies to be Used}
After due consideration and taking into account the received requirements, the following technologies will possibly be used:
\begin{description}
	\item[In order to develop the back end of the system (API and Web Server):]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{NodeJS}\hfill\\
			Node JS is a very popular web server hosting technology at this moment due 
			to its reliability, scalability and speed.
			\item{Express Framework}\hfill\\
			This framework will be used in conjunction with Node JS.
			\item{JavaScript front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap}\hfill\\
			This will be utilised for the GUI of the web server - simplistic, concise yet professional.
		\end{itemize}		
		
	\item[For the mobile app:]\hfill
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Xamarin or Android Studio}\hfill\\
		The decision has yet to be made on whether the C\# Xamarin approach will be used or the traditional Java in Android Studio approach, to develop an Android application. One of these two will however reign supreme.
	\end{itemize}
		
	
\end{description}
	
\subsubsection{Implementation Ideas}	

	
\subsubsection{Project Extension Ideas}
The following was considered as possible future extensions on the current project specifications:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Direct upload to server\\
	Instead of the malware sending the voice recording by email, one could perhaps use a server using some form of encryption and a very specific communication protocol which would then deter authorities to send fake data to the receiver in order to catch the culprit. One could perhaps disguise it in the form of something that looks quite normal, like uploading it to DropBox.
