\noindent \fbox{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{abrie}} I believe I am an academically focused individual. Knowedge and true comprehension have always formed the basis of my life. A number of years ago I realised that the beauty of Mathematics and Science is captured stunningly by the field of Computer Science. Since then I've embarked on a journey that I trust will lead me to great challenges, and great awe, and hopefully an awesome career. To me, honesty, integrity and quality service are some of the qualities that are lacking in this era, and I intend to set the record straight. \\

\roottitle{Non - Technical Strengths}

I enjoy my ability to work with a large set of culturally different people. I'm not afraid of experimentation, and I aim to learn from the mistakes I make along the way. At the same time I believe in a balance between disciplined, tried-and-tested protocols and methodologies, and creativity.

  {Because:}
  {As a Computer Science student, I have had little exposure to the mobile platform and as such I see this as a great opportunity to expand my range of expertise. This project also covers a broad range of topics and technologies that require an insight that I trust I'm able to deliver.}
