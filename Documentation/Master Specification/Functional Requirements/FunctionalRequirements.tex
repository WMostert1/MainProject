\section{Background}
South Africa is currently the largest producer of macadamia nuts in the world. One of the main production and quality limiting factors is the incidence of stink bug damage. 
\\Accurate scheduling of chemical sprays rely on accurate scout data and threshold levels of the insect pests in an orchard. However, scouting for these pests has
a major shortfall, namely the accurate identification of pests, despite efforts to train growers and scouts by various means.\\
Area wide control of pests and diseases is a concept that has been considered, but with the lack of scout data from across and within growing regions it is impossible to make such recommendations. \\

\section{Vision}
An innovative approach to handling the management and acquisition of scout data is to develop a smartphone application that is able to identify specific stink bug species by making use of the built-in camera of the smartphone. This application makes use of the smartphoneâ€™s built-in GPS to perform geotagging and uploading information to a central database. In addition to the data management, one of the primary goals is to supply data mining methods on historical data as obtained via the smartphone application. A visual representation of said data is therefore made available in a dynamic and easy way for the every day farmer and researcher.

	\subsection{BugScouting}
		The BugScouting module has the following functionality:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item It provides the functionality for a user to be able to enter data related to a scouting trip - entering data such as the number of trees scouted, the number of bugs per tree and the different kind of bugs specified. After this data has been entered, a summary should be displayed for the user.
			\item It provides the ability for a user to record the details related to spraying, such as the date of spraying and the specific block that was sprayed.
		\end{enumerate}

		In many ways this module may be regarded as the "core" functionality of the system. This encompasses the main purpose of the system.
		\subsubsection{Module Scope}
		The scope of the \textit{BugScouting} module is shown below:\\
		\hfill\\

		\subsubsection{Use Cases}
		The concrete use cases for the \textit{BugScouting} module follow:
		\paragraph{getBugInfo \dotfill [Priority - Medium]}
		This use case uses the BugIntelligence module to retrieve information on a specific specimen which will be used to display to the user a "wiki" like piece which has the purpose of informing the user.\\\hfill\\
		The Service Contract for the \textit{getBugInfo} use case is shown below:\\\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{getInfo}
