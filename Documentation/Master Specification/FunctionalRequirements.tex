\section{Background}
South Africa is currently the largest producer of macadamia nuts in the world. One of the main production and quality limiting factors is the incidence of stink bug damage. 
\\Accurate timing of chemical sprays rely on accurate scout data and economic threshold levels of the insect pests in an orchard. However, scouting for these pests has
a major shortfall, namely the accurate identification of pests, despite efforts to train growers and scouts by various means.\\
Area wide control of pests and diseases is a concept that has been considered, but with the lack of scout data from across and within growing regions it is impossible to make such recommendations. \\

\section{Vision}
An innovative approach to handling the management and acquisition of scout data is to develop a smartphone application that is able to identify specific hemipteran species by making use of the built-in camera of the smartphone. This application should ideally be able to make use of the smartphoneâ€™s built-in GPS to perform geotagging and uploading information to a central database.

	\subsection{BugScouting}
		The BugScouting module has the following functionality:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item It provides the functionality for a user to be able to enter data related to a scouting trip - entering data such as the number of trees scouted, the average number of bugs per tree and the different kind of bugs specified. After which a summary should be displayed.
			\item It provides the ability for a user to record the details related to spraying.
		\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Module Scope}
		The scope of the \textit{BugScouting} module is shown below:\\

\section{Architectural Requirements}
	\subsection{Quality Requirements}
		\subsubsection{Maintainability}
			As a standard requirement for all projects, SAMBUG needs to be maintainable. This is especially due to the fact that the project has very high expansion potential. SUBTROP has shown interest in further maintaining the project after completion.
		\subsubsection{Scalability}
			Since the user base for the system will be comparatively small, scalability is not a great issue. The load on the system will not under any foreseeable circumstances be extremely high.
		\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}
			Performance is a very important requirement for the system. The goal of the system is to provide an efficient service rendered. Users of the system will be subject to high pressure environments where time is an issue.
		\subsubsection{Reliability and Availability}
			Since users will be relying heavily on this system to make important business decisions the system must be available to be used at all times. As such, a reliable system is of paramount importance.
		\subsubsection{Security}
			As specified by the client, for the sake of reducing usage complexity of the system, the security may be relaxed in this case due to the fact that the users are generally not comfortable with using technological products.
		\subsubsection{Auditability}
			There is no specific auditability requirement for the system since there will be no business value in tracking user activity.
		\subsubsection{Testability}
			Every service offered by the system should be testable via:\\
			1. Unit tests\\
			2. Integration tests
		\subsubsection{Usability}
			Usability is the main quality requirement for the system. In order for the system to have any actual business value it should be easy to use and effective.
		\subsubsection{Deployability}
			The system must be deployable to any cloud hosted virtual machine or locally hosted server.
	\subsection{Architecture responsibilities}
	The architectural responsibilities of the system include providing infrastructure for the following:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A web access channel
			\item A mobile access channel
			\item Hosting for business logic and services offered by the system
			\item Relational database persistence
			\item Sending emails for recovering of accounts
		\end{itemize}
\section{Architectural Design}
	\subsection{Overview}
		A layered architecture will be used with the following layers:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Access Layer
					\begin{itemize}
						\item 
					\end{itemize}
				\item Services Layer
				\item Data Access Layer
			\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Infrastructure Layout}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{SystemComponents}	
	\subsection{Database Design}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ERD}	
	\subsection{Process Flow}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ProcessFlow}	
	\subsection{Technologies}
		\subsubsection{Mobile Application}
			\paragraph{Android Studio}
		\subsubsection{Web Backend}
			\paragraph{.NET WebAPI}
				The Microsoft .NET framework was chosen as a backend framework for hosting RESTful services. The following factors contributed to this decision:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The .NET framework is a tried and tested industry standard technology which adds value to the Reliability component of the 
							quality requirements.
					\item The .NET framework and packages used within the project became open source as announced by Microsoft at the Build 214 conference thus freeing the client from licencing fees. See the \href{http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects}{.NET Foundation}  for further details on open source Microsoft Packages.
					\item The main alternative to the .NET framework was the Java EE reference framework. Since Performance and Scalability is a very important quality requirement .NET was deemed superior due to case studies consulted:
							\begin{itemize}
								\item  \href{http://www.slideshare.net/tejasvirastogi/java-vs-net-24443514}{Testing .NET vs Java EE with basic web pages}
								\item  \href{http://www.seguetech.com/blog/2013/06/03/dotnet-vs-java-how-to-pick}{How to pick between Java and .NET}
								\item  \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18088/are-there-any-studies-comparing-java-ee-vs-net}{.NET vs Java Discussion}
							\end{itemize}
							It is worth noting that Java EE and .NET are very closely matched in many aspects. The difference between the two frameworks are nearly negligable in terms of performance.
					\item The .NET framework provides seameless integration with the other technologies utilised
					\item The .NET framework provides for quick and easy set-up for REST services and web front ends using MVC5		
				\end{itemize}
			\paragraph{.NET MVC 5}
				For the same reasons metioned for the choice of .NET WebAPI. MVC 5 was chosen as a pattern at a lower level of granularity due to the built in support for it in the .NET framework and it can be viewed in most cases as a industry standard for web applications.
			\paragraph{MSSQL Express}
					Express is the free version of the Microsoft RDBMS which caters for all the data needs of the system. This technology can easily be swopped out for other free database technologies such as MySQL
					due to the technology neutral architecural design.
			\paragraph{AutoFac}
					AutoFac is used as a mocking framework for unit testing as well as for dependency injection in order to fascilitate more effective unit testing and pluggability. Using this dependency injection framework code maintainability is also improved.
		\subsubsection{Web Frontend}
			\paragraph{Aurelia.io}
				Aurelia is the next generation JavaScript client framework for mobile, desktop and web. It provides two-way databinding (as does AngularJS) and extensible HTML as well as other great features such as client side dependency injection
				. Aurelia is the way forward for client side scripting frameworks. The other major competitor in this area is AngularJS. See \href{http://ilikekillnerds.com/2015/01/aurelia-vs-angularjs-round-one-fight/}{Aurelia vs AngularJS â€“ Round One: FIGHT!}
		\subsubsection{Builds}		
			\paragraph{TeamCity}
				TeamCity was chosen as a automated build and continious integration environment being run on a development server to fascilitate continious integration and better development as a team.
			\paragraph{Gradle}
			\paragraph{MSBuild}
				MSBuild is the standard build script language for the .NET development environment. Since it functions seamlessly there is no need to change this technology.
		\subsubsection{Testing}
			\paragraph{JUnit}
			\paragraph{MSTest}
				MSBuild is the standard testing pacakge for the .NET development environment. Since it functions seamlessly there is no need to change this technology.
