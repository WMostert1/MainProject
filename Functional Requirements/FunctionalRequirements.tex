\section{Background}
South Africa is currently the largest producer of macadamia nuts in the world. One of the main production and quality limiting factors is the incidence of stink bug damage. 
\\Accurate timing of chemical sprays rely on accurate scout data and economic threshold levels of the insect pests in an orchard. However, scouting for these pests has
a major shortfall, namely the accurate identification of pests, despite efforts to train growers and scouts by various means.\\
Area wide control of pests and diseases is a concept that has been considered, but with the lack of scout data from across and within growing regions it is impossible to make such recommendations. \\

\section{Vision}
An innovative approach to handling the management and acquisition of scout data is to develop a smartphone application that is able to identify specific hemipteran species by making use of the built-in camera of the smartphone. This application should ideally be able to make use of the smartphoneâ€™s built-in GPS to perform geotagging and uploading information to a central database.

	\subsection{BugScouting}
		The BugScouting module has the following functionality:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item It provides the functionality for a user to be able to enter data related to a scouting trip - entering data such as the number of trees scouted, the average number of bugs per tree and the different kind of bugs specified. After which a summary should be displayed.
			\item It provides the ability for a user to record the details related to spraying.
		\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Module Scope}
		The scope of the \textit{BugScouting} module is shown below:\\
		\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ScopeBugScouting}
		
		\subsubsection{Use Cases}
		The concrete use cases for the \textit{BugScouting} module follow:
		\paragraph{getBugInfo \dotfill [Priority - Medium]}
		This use case uses the BugIntelligence module to retrieve information on a specific specimen which will be used to display to the user a "wiki" like piece which has the purpose of informing the user.\\\hfill\\
		The Service Contract for the \textit{getBugInfo} use case is shown below:\\\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{getInfo}
		
		\paragraph{updateInfo \dotfill [Priority - Medium]}
		The objective of this use case is to provide functionality to retrieve updated bug information and identification method updates.\\\hfill\\
		The Service Contract for the \textit{getBugInfo} use case is shown below:\\\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{updateInfo}
		
		\paragraph{showTripSummary \dotfill [Priority - High]}
		After completing a full scouting trip, this use case should provide a summary of the entire scouting trip. One scouting trip may consist of many scouting stops. The averages for the scouting trip data is used in the summary.\\\hfill\\
		The Service Contract for the \textit{showTripSummary} use case is shown below:\\\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{showTripSummary}
		
		\paragraph{enterTreatmentData \dotfill [Priority - Critical]}
		This use case is for entering data related to spraying chemicals (pesticide). This allows for the type of chemical, the date and the block or orchard number to be recorded.\\\hfill\\
		
		The Service Contract for the \textit{enterTreatmentData} use case is shown below:\\\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{EnterTreatmentData}
		
		\paragraph{enterScoutingData \dotfill [Priority - Critical]}
		This is the core use case of this module. This use case allows entering data related to a scouting stop. Data captured should include the number of trees observed, number of bugs counter and the block or orchard number where the scouting took place. After entering the data, the specimen should be identified (classified) before successfully submitting it for persistence.\\\hfill\\
		The Service Contract for the \textit{enterScoutingData} use case is shown below:\\\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{enterScoutingData}
		
		
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%	
	
	\subsection{BugIntelligence}
		The BugIntelligence module has the following functionality:
		\begin{enumerate}		
			\item It provides a pluggable method to classify a specimen according to species and life stage.
			\item It provides an interface which can be used to obtain information related to any specific specimen which is identifiable by the system
			\item It provides CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) functionality for bug information for specimens identifiable by the identification method
		\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Module Scope}
		The scope of the \textit{BugIntelligence} module is shown below:\\
		\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{scopeBugIntel}
		\subsubsection{Use Cases}
		The concrete use cases for the \textit{BugIntelligence} module follow:
		
		\paragraph{classifyBug \dotfill [Priority - Critical]}
		This use case supplies a method to classify the bug according to life stage and species. The classification method used is pluggable.\\\hfill\\
		The Service Contract for the \textit{classifyBug} use case is shown below:\\\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{classifyBug}
		
		\paragraph{updateBugKnowledgeBase \dotfill [Priority - Low]}		
		This use case provides the functionality to edit the information used for classification. As in the example of a neural network being used as a classification method, the training examples may be edited.		
		The Service Contract for the \textit{updateBugKnowledgeBase} use case is shown below:\\\hfill\\
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{updateBugKnowledgeBase}
		
		\paragraph{readBugKnowledgeBase \dotfill [Priority - Critical]}
				This use case provides the functionality to get the information used for classification. As in the example of a neural network being used as a classification method, the training examples may be retrieved.
