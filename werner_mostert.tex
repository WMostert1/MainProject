\noindent \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{werner}\\I am a very driven person with very clear goals in terms of my career as well as my personal life. I believe in honesty above all else and making a valuable contribution towards society. In my opinion, one of the greatest injustices that can be done by man, is refusing to pass on what one has learnt and experienced, for without this happening there can be no progress. My dream is to be remembered for the feats that I had accomplished in my lifetime. I am extremely passionate about technology, specifically software development, which is the reason why I chose to study Computer Science at a tertiary level. I am particularly fond of new challenges that test my abilities allowing for growth, self-improvement and the improvement of others. My family and friends are an extremely important factor in my life and I would see them proud of the man that I am, and want to be.
